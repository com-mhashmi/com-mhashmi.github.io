Visit the map maker repository page [here](http://www.mhashmi.com/HAMMeRtroid)!
Visit the Super Metroid application repository page [here](http://www.mhashmi.com/Metroid)!
Working on developing a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) remake.
This is due to the fact that PS Vita development is a very seperated and slow development process. 
I am in the process of refactoring and transferring engine code as well as creating my own map creator! 
It's coming along well, although any advice or help would be greatly appreciated, please feel free to contact me!
