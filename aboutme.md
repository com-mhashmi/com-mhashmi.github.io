### My Professional Information

My name is Syed Isam Hashmi.
I am a software engineer, and have been since I was ten years old. I have a passion for computer science, and a craving for knowledge that I have yet to quench.

I am consistently attempting to utilize algorithm theory and object-oriented design tactics to lean towards efficiency for programs that I interface with daily in order to take our world one step further.

I am proficient in Java, C#, C, C++, HTML, JavaScript, CSS.
In my professional career, I have utilized .NET, and I am familiar with its use and application.
I am extremely interested in AR/VR/MR/XR technologies, and have developed for the Microsoft HoloLens.
I have engineered data forms that have increased effeciency more than ten fold for many companies by using open source libraries that utilize JSON schemas, C# reflection, and C# interfaces. 

### My Personal Information

#### My personal philosophy is that there is no such that as not having time. I believe in making time.
No matter the situation, I keep my head up and always focus on my objective.

I'm a 21 year old self-taught programmer with a bachelors degree in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Arlington. My dream is to become a video game developer. I plan to go into full-stack development until then.

I am always doing all I can to widen my skills and better my abilities. 

My passion is for learning, and I use computers as a means to satisfy my craving for knowledge. 

I absolutely love Physics and Calculus and enjoy learning about math and graphics related topics in my free-time.

Beyond computer languages, I love to learn languages. You name, I will learn it. 
I am currently able to read, speak, and write in Urdu, English, German, and Hindi. 
I have learned how to read and write Korean, and plan to further educate myself by speaking in the language as well.

I play guitar okay-ish? I wouldn't consider myself anything better than average, but I let off my steam from frustrating programs and long hours of staring at a screen through music and video games.
